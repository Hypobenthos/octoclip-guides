## 1. Install & Launch

- **macOS / Windows**
After installation, launching Octoclip will keep it running in the **system tray / menu bar**, working in the background automatically.

- **Android**
After installation, you need to grant permissions and enable a **foreground service** to keep Octoclip running reliably.

- **iOS**
Due to system restrictions, true background monitoring is not supported. Octoclip works only when in the foreground or triggered by a shortcut.

👉 See detailed steps: [Installation Guide](/getting-started/installation)

## 2. Try Clip History

Octoclip monitors **clipboard updates** and automatically saves them into **Clip History**.

This means you can:

- Always recover what you copied before
- Never worry about losing clipboard data
- Build the foundation for Quick Input, Aliases, and Cross-device Paste

### Steps

1. Copy a few texts or images
2. Open Octoclip’s **Clip History**
3. You’ll see the copied items already recorded

## 3. Background Clipboard Monitoring

Background monitoring ensures a complete history and timely sync.

- **macOS / Windows**
Enabled by default, no extra setup required.

- **Android**
Requires enabling a **foreground service** and **clipboard monitoring**, granting clipboard access, allowing background activity, and disabling battery optimizations.

- **iOS**
Currently limited: use the **Quick Copy** shortcut to manually trigger history and sync. Future versions will support a lightweight “Picture-in-Picture” mode for continuous monitoring.
